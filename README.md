Darker
======

A color scheme for Emacs by [Pferor](http://pferor.org).

I'm not entirely sure if this may be called “color scheme” since its a
gray scale combination. Colors are reserved for alerts and warnings
and text replacement.

Based on Alex Schroeder's *Late Night* color theme.

> This theme is for use late at night, with only little light in the
> room. The goal was to make something as dark and subtle as the text
> console in its default 80x25 state -- dark grey on black. (A. S.)
